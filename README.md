# Polly backend
### https://pollybee.herokuapp.com/

This is the source code for the backend server for my Polly project. I used Node.js with Express to handle the requests and MongoDB using Mongoose to store the data for the polls.
The backend is hosted on heroku using their free tier which is enough to showcase the functionality of the website. Although it does take a little bit of time to wake-up after inactivity.
